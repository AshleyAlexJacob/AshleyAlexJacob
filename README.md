I am a Skilled AI/ML Engineer with a passion for leveraging Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Cloud Computing to create impactful, real-world solutions. Currently, I'm applying my expertise as a Machine Learning Engineer at K2X Tech, a prominent Denmark-based company. My primary goal is to contribute to AI-driven research and the development of cutting-edge products across diverse sectors.

My journey in the field of data science and machine learning has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set. I excel in understanding complex business problems, designing innovative solutions, and efficiently preparing data for analysis. I have a wealth of experience in the crucial phases of the machine learning lifecycle, from pre-training and fine-tuning models using frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, to employing essential tools such as MLFlow and DVC for seamless machine learning lifecycle management.

One of my strengths lies in fine-tuning Language Model Models (LLMs) and NLP models to cater to various business use cases. Additionally, I specialize in implementing model optimization techniques to ensure that our models meet the high expectations of diverse stakeholders. My ability to lead communications with business stakeholders, conduct in-depth requirement analysis, and employ effective problem-solving techniques has allowed me to forge strong partnerships and drive project success.

Throughout my career, I've built a solid track record in developing end-to-end data-driven systems. I guarantee their robustness by rigorously testing through Unit, Integration, and Load Testing, and oversee the entire product development process. Furthermore, I have significant experience in packaging and deploying end-to-end ML-based products to cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and I am well-versed in containerization using Docker. My expertise also extends to establishing efficient CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth and automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

In addition to my machine learning and data science skills, I'm a diligent and insightful computer engineer who aims to make a positive impact on people's lives. My focus on success-driven solutions incorporates the latest AI and Data Science techniques, as well as expertise in Mobile and Web Engineering. Over my three-year career in the engineering sector, I've honed my skills on various platforms, programming languages, and frameworks.

I specialize in mobile application development using Flutter, and I have a strong foundation in Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn for various machine learning and deep learning tasks. With over two years of experience working with AWS, I am well-versed in cloud computing, and I have explored the power of Docker containers and established comprehensive CI/CD pipelines to streamline software development and deployment.

My GitHub profile showcases the fusion of these two skill sets, encompassing my work in AI/ML, cloud computing, and software engineering. I am committed to advancing the field of AI and contributing to the betterment of society through innovative technical solutions.
